# LeShawn_Portfolio
1. The first problem I ran into was the portfolio container and the following containers were all pushed to the left side of the browser. I was not sure why this had happened as I copy/paste the code from the folders. Maybe I made a mistake when creating the folders from scratch.

    >> Solution: I decided to start from scratch and copied the folder structure from the template download into my local repository and it corrected the issue.
